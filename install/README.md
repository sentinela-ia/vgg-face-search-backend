VGG Face Search Installers
==========================

These scripts are meant for local deployment on your computer. This means that they will download and install third-party software and data in your computer, as well as compile and configure source code. The scripts are experimental and are intended for **Software Developers**. Regular users are strongly advised to use the docker version of the application.

In all cases, you will need a C++ compiler and Python 3 installed on your system. For GPU support you will need the NVIDIA drivers and the CUDA Toolkit in your system.

All scripts contain requirements and some instructions at the beginning of the file. Please read them before attempting the deployment.

Remember that before the first use you need to configure `vgg_face_search`. See the `Usage` section of the README in the root folder of this repository.
